CA resident license #0172748Mortgage products and services offered through Credit Karma Mortgage, Inc. NMLS ID#1588622ELIGIBILITY AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS; PERSONAL LOAN INTEREST RATES AND FEES. You can see personal loan offers on the Credit Karma personal loan marketplace from third party advertisers from which Credit Karma receives compensation. Credit Karma members are shown offers with Outstanding Approval Odds† when available to them. Offers with Outstanding Approval Odds have rates that range from 3.99% APR to 35.99% APR with terms from 1 to 10 years. Rates are subject to change without notice and are controlled by our third party advertisers, not Credit Karma. Depending on the particular lender, other fees may apply, such as origination fees or late payment fees. See the particular lender's terms and conditions for additional details. All loan offers on Credit Karma require your application and approval by the lender. You may not qualify for a personal loan at all or you may not qualify for the lowest rates or the highest offer amounts.PERSONAL LOAN REPAYMENT EXAMPLE. The following example assumes a $15,000 personal loan with a four year (48 month) term. For APRs ranging from 3.99% to 35.99%, monthly payments would range from $339 to $594. Assuming all of the 48 payments are made on-time, the total amount paid would range from $16,253 to $28,492.† Approval Odds are not a guarantee of approval. Credit Karma determines Approval Odds by comparing your credit profile to other Credit Karma members who were approved for the personal loan, or whether you meet certain criteria determined by the lender. Of course, there's no such thing as a sure thing, but knowing your Approval Odds may help you narrow down your choices. For example, you may not be approved because you don't meet the lender's ""ability to pay standard"" after they verify your income and employment; or, you already have the maximum number of accounts with that specific lender.",4.6,3000000,50000000,Everyone,Popular apps,"#6 top free finance, Finance"

72,Microsoft Authenticator,"Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.Getting started with multi-factor authenticationMulti factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app.The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.Getting started with passwordlessUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.Getting started with autofillMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.Microsoft personal, work or school accountsSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.Optional Access permissions:Microsoft Authenticator includes the following optional access permissions. All these require user consent. If you choose to not grant these optional access permissions, you can still use Microsoft Authenticator for other services that do not require such permission. For more information see https://aka.ms/authappfaqAccessibility Service: Used to optionally support Autofill on more apps and sites.Location: Sometimes your organization wants to know your location before allowing you to access certain resources. The app will request this permission only if your organization has a policy requiring location.Camera: Used to scan QR codes when you add a work, school, or non-Microsoft account.Read the contents of your storage: This permission is only used when you report a technical problem through the app settings.

Enough memes to knock out a moderately-sized mammal. Add to it or simply scroll through and soak it up.Every piece of life-changing art you discover, every waterfall GIF you gaze at in wonder, every quote you reblog, every tag you curate—that’s all you. Reblog them to show the world who you are, what you love. You’re the explorer. We’re just a map you all keep on making. Welcome home. Make it yours.If you’re an artist, you’re coming in hot to a community that will love your work. Think of this as your online studio with many options: A portfolio, your calling card for your creations with in-built social engagement and community, or an online drawing board, a place to hash out ideas, share sketches, and gather feedback. Take requests and commissions or join art challenges like Goblin Week, Mermay, Julycanthropy, and Yeehawgust. Discuss the finer points of your favorite brushes. Create OC art for your favorite writers on Tumblr. Sell prints (coasters! mugs! tchotchkes!) of your work—to an audience invested in you and actively seeking these things via our Artist Alley. Create a webcomic (have you heard of Heartstopper? Started here.)Now picture all of the above, but on the go. That’s what this is.-Chances are if you’ve seen it elsewhere, it probably started here. That digital painting you can’t stop thinking about. That text post explaining the exquisite specifics of something you never realized you needed to know. Your dashboard will become a tapestry of all the wonderful, nonsensical, fantastical things you like. Whether you post, lurk in likes, or reblog to your personal online fridge. Whatever your community, you’ll find a ready-made home here.When you have something to say—a hot take on the finer points of a Virgo moon, Barbie fanfic, an image of your turtle Harold that you simply *have* to share with the world: Shoot your shot with a photo, a video, or a text post. Make an audio post of your ramblings or share your current favorite song via Spotify. We even have a pre-set chat post for all your incorrect quotes.The reblog starts conversations for everyone, creates jokes, and continues them—sometimes across the world and over the years. Time and space, right here at your very fingertips. Whatever you choose to send into our effervescent digital ether, know that it can, and will, go anywhere. (Unless, of course, you use our post-level reblog controls. Private blog? Private post? All possible here).Tumblr is the home of fandom. We’ve all got that one special blorbo from our shows. There’s fanart you’ll want to stare at, reblog, stare at again—or create yourself, and share with the community. You can read your favorite ficcers from ao3 *and* see their OC art on Tumblr *and* discuss the finer points of lore with them. Pokémon? Got it. Marvel? Here. Kpop? Check. Supernatural? Of course. Minecraft? Ready and waiting. Star Wars? Yes! Doctor Who? Doctor YOU! You get the idea: it’s all here.It’s a whole universe out here.
