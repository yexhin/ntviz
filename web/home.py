                    _:blue[**"Data is the most valuable currency"**]_, is an undeniable truth as it plays a key role in various industries and fields, such as:
                    - **Decision-making support:** Providing information and analysis to help organizations and individuals make reliable decisions, from business strategies to product and service details.
                    - **Improving operational efficiency:** Helping optimize processes by providing insights into performance, procedures, and customer data, enabling organizations to adjust and enhance efficiency.
                    - **Developing products and services:** Offering insights into market demand and feedback, aiding businesses in understanding customer expectations and developing suitable products and services.

                **1. Conveying information effectively:**
                - Visualization represents complex data in easy-to-understand images, allowing viewers to quickly grasp information without analyzing detailed data tables.

                **2. Supporting decision-making:**
                - Charts and visuals help decision-makers recognize trends, identify issues, and provide suitable solutions based on specific data.

                **3. Discovering trends and relationships:**
                - Visualization highlights trends, patterns, and hidden relationships between variables in data that may be overlooked when only examining raw data.

                **4. Communicating and persuading:**
                - Charts and visuals assist in persuading others, particularly in presentations, reports, or data-driven arguments.

                **5. Enhancing data analysis capabilities:**
                - Helps analysts delve deeper into data, detect anomalies (outliers), or explore aspects previously unconsidered, leading to more comprehensive analyses.

                **6. Increasing data interaction:**
                - Enables interaction with data through visuals and vital numerical information such as sales, distributions, etc.

                **7. Creating excitement about data:**
                - Vibrant and intuitive visuals not only make data less dry but also help non-specialists delve deeper into data and related issues simply and understandably.

                    Best suited for datasets with ≤ 10 columns. For larger datasets, preprocessing is necessary (select relevant columns).
                    ##### 3. Functionality: 
                    LIDA works with .csv or .json format datasets.
                    ##### 4. Efficiency: 
                    LIDA performs best with large LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4). Smaller models may not follow instructions as effectively.
                    ##### 5. Accuracy: 
                    Error rate < 3.5% across 2200 generated charts, significantly lower than the baseline (>10%).
