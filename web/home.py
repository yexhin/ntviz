                **1. Conveying information effectively:**
                - Visualization represents complex data in easy-to-understand images, allowing viewers to quickly grasp information without analyzing detailed data tables.

                **2. Supporting decision-making:**
                - Charts and visuals help decision-makers recognize trends, identify issues, and provide suitable solutions based on specific data.

                **3. Discovering trends and relationships:**
                - Visualization highlights trends, patterns, and hidden relationships between variables in data that may be overlooked when only examining raw data.

                **4. Communicating and persuading:**
                - Charts and visuals assist in persuading others, particularly in presentations, reports, or data-driven arguments.

                **5. Enhancing data analysis capabilities:**
                - Helps analysts delve deeper into data, detect anomalies (outliers), or explore aspects previously unconsidered, leading to more comprehensive analyses.

                **6. Increasing data interaction:**
                - Enables interaction with data through visuals and vital numerical information such as sales, distributions, etc.

                **7. Creating excitement about data:**
                - Vibrant and intuitive visuals not only make data less dry but also help non-specialists delve deeper into data and related issues simply and understandably.

                    Best suited for datasets with ‚â§ 10 columns. For larger datasets, preprocessing is necessary (select relevant columns).

                    LIDA performs best with large LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4). Smaller models may not follow instructions as effectively.
